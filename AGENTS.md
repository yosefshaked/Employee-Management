# AGENTS

## Code Style
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Prefer ES module syntax.

## Workflow
- Lint any changed JavaScript or JSX files with `npx eslint <files>`.
- Run `npm run build` to ensure the project builds.
- No test script is configured; note this in your testing summary.

## Documentation
- When editing files in `ProjectDoc/`, keep `Eng.md` and `Heb.md` in sync and update their version and last-updated fields.
